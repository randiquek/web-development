# # Python Basics - String Manipulation - Exercise
# In the String Manipulation lesson, we worked with strings in Python. In this exercise,
# we want to see your understanding of string manipulation. We have provided some questions and guidance.
# ## Upon Completion

# 1. Given a string, split the values into individual values.
to_be_changed="John Glenn|Neil Armstrong|Sally Ride|Douglas Wheelock|Mae Jemison"
changed_values = to_be_changed
print(changed_values)

# 2. We were given these lyrics to split for a karaoke machine.  Split the lyrics by line using `split()`.
lyrics = """
Katie Casey was baseball mad,
Had the fever and had it bad.
Just to root for the home town crew,
Ev'ry sou
Katie blew.
On a Saturday her young beau
Called to see if she'd like to go
To see a show, but Miss Kate said "No,
I'll tell you what you can do:"
"""
lyrics_split = lyrics
print(lyrics_split)

# 3. We were given these lyrics to split for a karaoke machine.  Split the lyrics by line using something other than `split()`.

# 4. How long is the long village name string?
long_village_name = "Llanfair­pwllgwyngyll­gogery­chwyrn­drobwll­llan­tysilio­gogo­goch"
string_length = long_village_name

# 5. We want all folders in this path without additional spaces.  How would you get that?
my_path = '   /c/Users/instructor/Downloads/Submit Relating the Nonrelational Assessment Download May 10, 2021 917 AM          '

# 6. Given this list of names, change the third name in the list to be "Wolfgang Mozart".
composers="Beethoven,Ludwig von;Liszt,Franz;Mozart,Wolfgang;Copland,Aaron"
# Separate the composers
composers_split = composers
# Get the third composer
third_composer = composers_split[2]
# Find the comma in the name
comma_position = third_composer
# Use the slicing notation to get the last name
#   last_name = third_composer[]
# Use the slicing notation to get the first name
#   first_name = third_composer[]
# Join the names to get the 3rd composer's name in "first last" format
#   third_composer_name
# Print the composer's name
#   print(third_composer_name)


# 6. Given a right padded string and a left padded string, clean the strings to get the output of "Call now! Operators are standing by"
# Hint: You will need to include the `!` when putting the strings together.
left_padded = '                 Operators are standing by'
right_padded = 'Call now                   '
print()

# 7. Given the student name, grade, and assignment ID, using old style formating, print out the following:
# 
# ```
# 'Student name: Owen, Assignment ID: 0012, Grade: 94.75%'
# ```
# 
# Hint: to get the % to appear in the output, you will need to use `%%` to represent the percentage sign in an old style substitution string.
student_name = "Owen"
grade = 94.75
assignment_number = 12
print()

# 8. Given the employee ID of "30", pad the string with zeroes on the left to have the employee ID appear as 6-digits "000030".
employee_id = "30"
employee_id_padded = employee_id
print(employee_id_padded)

# 9. Convert the following strings based on their variable names.
i_want_to_yell = 'yeah'
I_NEED_TO_BE_QUIET = 'SHHHHH'
this_is_a_title = 'this is a title'
sWAPcASE = 'sWAPcASE'
capitalize_this = 'capitalize this'
