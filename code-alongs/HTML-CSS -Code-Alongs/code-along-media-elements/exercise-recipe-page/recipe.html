        <p>
            This creamy chicken recipe was one I came up with in my random creations of experimenting. This is a dish that uses chicken and heavy cream to give the sauce a good thickness similar to alfredo sauce. The tomato juice and diced tomatoes give it a nice light red color. I make this a lot (when I'm not too lazy). This dish makes about 2-4 servings but mostly 2 because you'll definitely come back for seconds.
