            <h3>World of Warcraft</h3>
            <img src="images/wow.jpg">
            <p><strong>World of Warcraft</strong> (WoW) is a 2004 massively multiplayer online role-playing (MMORPG) video game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment for Windows and Mac OS X. 
                <br>
                Set in the Warcraft fantasy universe, World of Warcraft takes place within the world of Azeroth, approximately four years after the events of the previous game in the series, Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne.[3] 
                <br>
                The game was announced in 2001, and was released for the 10th anniversary of the Warcraft franchise on November 23, 2004. Since launch, World of Warcraft has had ten major expansion packs: 
                <br>
                The Burning Crusade (2007), Wrath of the Lich King (2008), Cataclysm (2010), Mists of Pandaria (2012), Warlords of Draenor (2014), Legion (2016), Battle for Azeroth (2018), Shadowlands (2020), Dragonflight (2022),  
                <br>
                and The War Within (2024).
                <br>
                Two further expansions, Midnight and The Last Titan, were announced in 2023.</p>

            <h3>Additonal Info</h3>
            <p>I've played this game for a <em>long</em> time between 2010 and 2022. Even though I don't play anymore, WoW still remains to be one of my <span style="color:blueviolet">all-time </span>favorites
                <br>
               Maybe I'll revisit it in the future, but unfortunately, sometimes the game can be time consuming with thousands of hours of content.
